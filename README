MAC PAN IS FUCKING RAD.

To start the backend server, which serves the index.html page, "ruby webserver.rb"  

To start the websocket listener, "ruby mac-pan.rb" (serves the data back and forth to the start stub)


To start the stub for testing, 'ruby start.rb' (stubs out the up down left right input)

###
### to get the compilation stuff working, make sure you pull the most recent stuff from github, then do bundle install
### Then do "cd frontend" and "bundle exec tipsy"

That will start a server on port 4000 that serves the compiled index.html and sass and js and everything.
