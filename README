MAC PAN IS FUCKING RAD.

To start the backend server, which serves the index.html page, "ruby webserver.rb"  

To start the websocket listener, "ruby mac-pan.rb" (serves the data back and forth to the start stub)


To start the stub for testing, 'ruby start.rb' (stubs out the up down left right input)
